# RPN-CALCULATOR
A project created in 2018 for the programming classes during the studies. </br>
The entire rpn algorithm is implemented in  __calculation.cpp__ and __conversion.cpp__ files.
***
## Calculator options:
* supports trygonometric functions like:**"sin, cos, ctg, tan"** and mathematical expressions e.g.,  **"ln,!,^,%,"**.
* supports PI constant - **pi**, and Euler's constant-**e**.
* Calculates the value of the function with one unknown variable ('x,X') in specific range and step defined by the user (Whole output is saved to .txt file).
* Displaying entered expression in Reverse Polsih notation.
* Results can be displayed in predefined by user precision.
* Calculator detects errors and indicates their place in expression, e.g x/0, (-1)!, ln(-1).
